# voxel-rs

`voxel-rs` is a hobby voxel raycaster. It's not trying to be a game or a general purpose renderer. It's just for fun and learning. Specifically I'm using this project to learn Rust and WebGPU, and to explore interesting graphics programming techniques in relation to voxels.

## Future roadmap

- World interaction (building, breaking, etc.)
- De/serialisation. I want to be able to save and load worlds, and import various formats for testing.
- Pathtraced lighting and global illumination. Probably ReSTIR GI with A-SVGF denoising
